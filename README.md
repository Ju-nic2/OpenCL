# OpenCL
## introduction   
Thank you for comming! 
This repository is for OpenCL Study    
I want to study about heterogenous System, Parallel Programming, GPGPU, FPGA .. and so on     

## Development Environment 
CPU : intel(R) core(TM) i7-9700 CPU @ 3.00GHz    
     compute unit : 8   
     max work - item demenstion : 3    
     max work - item size: 8192    
     max work - group size: 8192     

GPU : Inter(R) UHD Graphics 630 
     compute unit : 24   
     max work - item demenstion : 3    
     max work - item size: 256    
     max work - group size: 256     
IDE : Visual studio 2019 With Intel SKD for OpenCL Applications     
OS : Window 10 1
     
## Plan       
I'll upload some example codes whenever i understand about OpenCl components    
In future I'll do projects with OpenCL
