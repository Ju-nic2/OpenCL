# vector Add code 
## introduction
I made this program to be familiar with openCL (Grammer, function name, .. )   
This program provides just checking Performance difference with CPU and GPU    

## Run
1. You can choose platform to run     
2. you can choose device    
(choose each Platform & Device only 1)
3. You can write data size (under MAX INTEGER)

## Operation 
Provide vector ADD
Program made 3 vectors    
1,2 is operand and fill with just i(0 ~ n-1)
3 is for result    


In Conclusion you can see running time about Device 

## about Version
Only vecadd_final.cpp can provide choce function.    
others are choose GPU automatically.

Thank you!
