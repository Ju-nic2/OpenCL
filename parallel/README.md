## Task vs Data 
** In GPU -> Task <<< Data (Approximately 100x faster use all compute unit)   
** In CPU -> Task =< Data (almost same)    

## Time efficiency per compute unit (Data parallel)
use  1 compute unit -> 100   
use  2 compute unit -> 85    
use  4 compute unit -> 75    
use 16 compute unit -> 72
